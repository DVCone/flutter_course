# Dart Fundamental

## 01. Introduction to Dart Fundamental
We have learned how to create a simple “Hello, World!” application. using Darts. In this module we will learn the basic concepts of Darts. Some of the topics we will study include *variables, data types, operators, and functions*.

&emsp;
## 02. Comments
Before starting to develop more complex applications, there is one more important thing we need to know, namely instructions to the computer to ignore parts of a program. Code written in a program but not executed by a computer is called "comments."

A comment will be passed during the compilation process, so it will not affect the flow of the program we write. Comments can be used as documentation that explains the code that we write. 
There are three types of comments that can be used on Dart. 

**The first** is a single-line comment or one-line comment that begins with a `//` sign and ends at the end of that line.

```dart
// Single line comment
```

**The second** is a multi-line comment where we can write several lines of comments. This comment starts with `/* and ends with */`.

```dart
/*
  multi
  line
  comment
*/
```

**The last** is the documentation comment. This comment is a single-line comment or multi-line comment that begins with `/// or /**`.

In the documentation comment, the Dart compiler will ignore all text except those enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`. Inside the square brackets we can enter a reference from the name of a class, variable, or function. The following is an example of using comments:

```dart
import 'package:Learn_Dart/Learn_Dart.dart' as Learn_Dart;

/// The [main] function will display 2 outputs
/// The first output displays text and the second output displays the multiplication results in the [Learn_Dart] library
void main(List<String> arguments) {
  // Create "Hello Darts! Darts are great." on console
  print('Hello Dart! Dart is great.');
  // Testing documentation comment with [].
  print('6 * 7 = ${Learn_Dart.calculate()}');
}

/*
  output:
    Hello Dart! Dart is great.
    6 * 7 = 42
 */
```

If you use the IDE and then press **Ctrl** and hover over the text in square brackets, then you will be able to click and navigate to the reference code. It is good practice to write comments on code. But note, "Good code has a lot of comments, while bad code requires a lot of comments."

&emsp;
## 03. Variables
When we write a program, we tell the computer how to process information such as printing text to a screen or performing computational operations. To make it easier to use and call this data, we can use variables. A variable can be thought of as a box or container that stores values. In the computer this variable is stored in the computer's memory. Each variable has a name that we can call and use.

In Dart we define a variable with the `var keyword`.

```dart
var greetings = 'Hello Dart!';
```

Notice the equal sign (=) above. This symbol is known as the **assignment operator**. The above code means that we enter the value of 'Hello Dart!' into a box or variable named greetings. The process of assigning values ​​to these variables is called initialization.

Next let's try to output the value of this variable to the console. Change your main function code to something like this:

```dart
void main() {
  var greetings = 'Hello Dart!';
  print(greetings);
}
```

In the code example above we enter data in the form of text into a variable. Then, what about numeric data or in the form of numbers? Of course, I can. You can simply initialize the variable with a numeric value.

```dart
var myAge = 20;
print(myAge);
```

So what if we want to create a variable but don't want to initialize it right away? Say you want to wait for some operation to finish then initialize it into a variable.

This process is called variable declaration. The variable declaration will store the name and space in memory without assigning a value. You can initialize the value after declaration according to your requirement.

```dart
var myAge;
myAge = 20;
print(myAge);
```

Now try to comment the variable initialization code above and run the program, what happens?

Is your console displaying null? Each variable declaration will return a default value of null. This means that the variable has not been initialized or you could say that your variable has no value or is null.

&emsp;
## 04. Data Types
In the previous material we have learned about variables that can store values. So how do computers distinguish between a variable that is a number or a text value? And why is it important to be able to tell the difference?

Darts has many data types that represent the types of data we can use and how they are operated. With data types, computers can avoid operations that are impossible and can generate bugs, such as multiplying alphabetic characters or converting numbers to capitals.

Dart is a language that supports type `inference`. When you declare a variable with `var`, Dart will automatically determine its data type. For example :

```dart
var greetings = 'Hello Dart!';  // String
var myAge = 20;                 // integers
```

The computer will know that the `greetings` variable has a `String` or text value and the `myAge` variable has a `number or integer` value even if we don't explicitly define it.

You can still declare variable data types explicitly to avoid confusion and make *debugging* easier.

```dart
String greetings = 'Hello Dart!';
int myAge = 20;
```

Some of the data types supported by Dart include:
<br>
|No   |Type       | Desc                |Example                  |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
|1.   |int        |Integer              |5, -7, 0                 |
|2.   |double     |Decimals             |3.14, 18.0, -12.12       |
|3.   |num        |Integers & decimal   |5, 3.14, -12.12          |
|4.   |bool       |Boolean              |true, false              |
|5.   |String     |Text                 |'me', ' ', ''            |
|6.   |List       |Data List            |[1, 2, 3], ['a','b','c'] |
|7.   |Map        |Key-value pairs      |{“x”: 4, “y”: 10}        |
|8.   |dynamic    |all data type        |                         |

Dart supports type *inference*, interestingly when we declare a variable without initializing it, the variable will have a **dynamic** type. Since a variable with *dynamic* value can contain any type, there is no problem if we change the value in it.

```dart
var x;  // dynamic
x = 7;
x = 'Dart is great';
print(x);
```

The code above can still run and display the message 'Dart is great' without any problems. It's different if we initialize the value of the variable `x` directly. As a result, the editor will display an error due to a data type change.

```dart
var x = 7;  // int
x = 'Dart is great'; // error assignment
print(x);
```

### Accept user input
In addition to displaying messages to the console, we can also receive user input for further processing and display. This allows us to create applications that are interactive with the user.

To be able to accept input, we will use the statement `stdin.readLineSync()`. This function is part of the `dart:io` library, so we need to import the library.

```dart
import 'dart:io';
```

This time we're going to create a simple app that accepts name and age input from the user and then displays a message to the console. Before looking at the solution code below can you translate the following *flowchart* into application code?

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

### Solution
In the above problem we need to display the output, accept some input, and display the output again according to the given input. The code you need to write is more or less like this:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
 
void main() {
  stdout.write('Your Name : ');
  String name = stdin.readLineSync()!;
  stdout.write('Your Age : ');
  int age = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
  print('Halo $name, Your Age is $age years old');
}
```

If your code is different because it uses `print()` then no problem. The `print()` and `stdout.write()` statements have the same function, which is to output an object to the console. The difference is that `print()` will print a new line after displaying something so next you need to enter the input on a new line. While `stdout.write()` only displays the object and when there is new input or output it will still be displayed on the same line.

In addition, we add the `!` after `stdin.readLineSync()` to indicate that the input will not return a `null` value. We will discuss the explanation regarding the null value in more detail later in the null safety material.

Another new code is `int.parse()`. We use this code to convert `String` data type to `int`. The input taken from `stdin.readLineSync()` will have a `String` data type. So when we want to store and operate input in other data types we need to do the conversion first.

&emsp;
## 05. Numbers
Numeric data types on Darts can be stored in two types: `int` and `double`.

*Integers* value are ​​not bigger than 64 bits depending on the platform used. For Dart VM *integer* variables can store values ​​ranging from -2^63 to 2^63 - 1, while compiled to JavaScript *integers* have values ​​from -2^53 to 2^53 - 1. An *integer* is a number that does not have a decimal point. Examples are as follows:

```dart
var number = 2020;
var hex = 0xDEADBEEF;
```

If a number is a decimal number, then the number is a `double` data type. `Double` also has a size of 64 bits. The following is an example of a `double` variable:

```dart
double withoutDecimal = 7; 
// is same as 
double withoutDecimal = 7.0;
```

*Int* and *double* are subtypes of the *num* data type. We can use these three data types to perform basic calculations such as addition, multiplication, to use functions such as `abs(), ceil(), floor(),` and many other functions. If you need calculation operations but they are not available on these three data types then you can take advantage of the `dart:math` library.

In the previous material we had a need to convert type `String` to `int`. This data type conversion is important and we will need it a lot. In addition to converting `String` to `int`, we can also convert double to String or vice versa.

```dart
// String -> int
var eleven = int.parse('11');

// String -> double
var elevenPointTwo = double.parse('11.2');
  
// int -> String
var elevenAsString = 11.toString();
  
// double -> String
var piAsString = 3.14159.toStringAsFixed(2); // String piAsString = '3.14'
```
