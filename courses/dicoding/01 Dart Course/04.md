# Control Flow

## 01. Introduction to Control Flow
Every day we do calculations and comparisons to make decisions, whatever it is. For example, is it necessary to wash the vehicle when the weather is sunny? What online transportation can be ordered when it rains to get to your destination?

A program also needs to make decisions. In this module we will learn how to give instructions for the computer to make decisions from given conditions as well as how to carry out repeated instructions.

## 02. If - Else
When developing a program, we will meet with a branching path depending on the conditions that occur. To accommodate and check a condition on Dart we use the `if` keyword. 

The `if` expression will test a condition. If the result of the expression evaluates to *true*, the code block in it will be executed. Conversely, if it evaluates to *false* then the specified process will be passed.

```dart
void main() {
  var isRaining = true;
 
  print('Prepare before going to office.');
  if (isRaining) {
    print("Oh. It is raining, bring an umbrella.");
  }
  print('Going to the office.');
}
```

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

```bash
> Prepare before going to office.
> Oh. It is raining, bring an umbrella.
> Going to the office.
```

If you change the value of `isRaining` to `false`, then the code inside the `if` block will be skipped and your program won't remind you to bring an umbrella. 

Then what if you want to perform another operation when the condition evaluates to *false*?, The answer is to use `else`. In the following code example we will perform condition checks on comparison operators and logical operators.

```dart
void main() {
  var openHours = 8;
  var closedHours = 21;
  var now = 17;
 
  if (now > openHours && now < closedHours) {
    print("Hello, we're open");
  } else {
    print("Sorry, weâ€™ve closed");
  }
}
```

You can also check multiple conditions at once by combining `else` and `if`. For example, the following value conversion program:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
 
void main() {
  stdout.write('Input your Score (1-100) : ');
  var score = num.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
  
  print('Your Grade is: ${calculateScore(score)}');
}
 
String calculateScore(num score) {
  if (score > 90) {
    return 'A';
  } else if (score > 80) {
    return 'B';
  } else if (score > 70) {
    return 'C';
  } else if (score > 60) {
    return 'D';
  } else {
    return 'E';
  }
}
```

Another interesting feature of Dart is **conditional expressions**. With this we can write an if-else statement in just one line:

```dart
// condition ? true expression : false expression
var shopStatus = now > openHours ? "Hello, we're open" : "Sorry, we've closed";
```

In addition, Dart also supports conditional expressions such as the following:

```dart
expression1 ?? expression2
var buyer = name ?? 'user';
```

In the code above, if the variable `name` is `not null`, the `buyer` will store the value of `name`. However, if the value is `null`, the `buyer` will contain `'user'`. Unlike the previous modules that use *flowcharts*, can you make a program this time or understand the meaning of the following image?

```dart
void main() {
  int? milk = 10;
  bool? eeg = true;
  
  if (eeg == false) {
    print(milk - 1);
  } else {
    print (milk - 3);
  }
}
```
