# Flutter Introduction

## 01. Flutter Framework
Technology has become an inseparable part of our lives, especially smartphones . According to data from We Are Social , in January 2020 internet users in Indonesia reached around 175.4 million people. There is an increase of 17% or around 25 million users from 2019. If you look at the total population of Indonesia which is around 272.1 million people, then 64% of them have access to the internet. With the massive number of smartphone users, the requirements for an application developer are becoming more specific . Including requirements on mobile devices targeting Android and iOS platforms. Each platform has an application it's own native .

Developing two platforms has many implications. From a business perspective, the costs that need to be incurred are certainly not cheap. Two apps means there are two types of developers to hire and two types of development to manage. If there is a technology that allows application development on several platforms at once with only one codebase, it's certainly more economical, right? Definitely more efficient in terms of cost, time, and energy.

Interested in studying the technology stack that can make it happen? Let's get acquainted with Flutter. This is a popular and powerful framework made by Google, Flutter is here to develop multi-platform applications that are compiled natively.

## 02. What is Flutter
Flutter is an SDK ( Software Development Kit ) developed by Google to create good applications that can run on multiple platforms. Flutter 2 which is the latest version provides support for you to build applications on Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux, and MacOS operating systems. With this, you only need to code once or known as a single codebase . Flutter has also been used by many developers and organizations around the world, besides Flutter is open source .

### Why Flutter
Flutter is different from most other Cross-platform SDKs for building mobile apps . To draw widgets , Flutter uses neither a WebView nor OEM widgets , but a high-performance rendering engine. Flutter can be used in conjunction with existing native apps or used in its entirety for new apps. 

There are several advantages of Flutter, including:

1. **Flutter allows us to create beautiful applications (beautiful)**
Designers can freely create without the many limitations of the framework . Flutter can also control every pixel on the screen, making it easier to create animations. Flutter provides many material design components that work well on Android, iOS, and the web.

2. **Flutter runs very fast**
Flutter uses a graphic engine called Skia-2D which is also used on Chrome and Android. Flutter code uses the Dart language, which allows it to be compiled to native 32-bit and 64-bit ARM code for iOS and Android.

3. **Flutter is very productive**
Flutter has a hot-reload feature that allows you to view compilation results in real-time . With hot-reload , you can easily see code changes on your device, without waiting for a restart and losing state 

4. **Flutter is open source**
Flutter is an open source project with a BSD license. The code in Flutter comes from contributions from hundreds of developers from around the world. Many plugins have been made by developers. You can contribute to the development of Flutter by reporting bugs/issues or helping improve existing code. You can find the source code for Flutter at `https://github.com/flutter/flutter`.

### Flutter Development History
The first version of Flutter named Sky was announced at the 2015 Dart Developer Summit. At that time, Sky only ran on the Android operating system. 

Then, on Google Developer Days in Shanghai, Google announced the Release Preview version of Flutter 2 which was a release before the stable 1.0 version.

On March 3, 2021 yesterday, Flutter announced a version of Flutter 2 with a fairly major update, namely Flutter support for web and desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS) which entered the stable version .

Since the release of the first beta, Flutter has been widely used to develop mobile applications . Examples are Abbey Road Studios, Alibaba, Capital One, Groupon, Hamilton, JD.com, Philips Hue, Reflectly, Tencent, and GITS Indonesia.

### Dart
As we already know, Flutter application is written in Dart language. You should have learned about Darts fundamentals in the Getting Started Programming with Darts class . To refresh your memory we will review a little about Dart.

Dart programming language is a general-purpose programming language designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund. This programming language was developed as an application programming language that can be easily learned and deployed.

This programming language made by Google can be used to develop various platforms including the web, mobile applications, servers, and devices that carry Internet of Things (IoT) technology.

This programming language can be used to develop applications that run on a variety of modern browsers. Dart can also be used to develop applications from a single codebase into Android and iOS applications.

The Dart programming language can be used freely by developers because it is released open-source by Google under the BSD license. Dart programming language is a class-based and object-oriented programming language using the C programming language Syntax .

This language was introduced by Google as a replacement for the JavaScript programming language, but optionally it can be compiled into JavaScript using the Dart-to-JavaScript compiler . Slightly different from the dynamic type JavaScript programming language, the Dart programming language is a static type programming language.

Okay, so far we have learned about what Flutter is, including its history and why we need to learn to develop applications with Flutter. In this class you will learn the basics of developing Flutter applications, such as packages , commonly used widgets , how to move pages using Navigation, to the process of building into APKs that can be installed on your smartphone.

> Note: The material in this class will be delivered in many options, ranging from the operating system (OS), Android or iOS platform, and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Please adjust it according to your hardware/software specifications and skip material that you feel is not needed. 

To pass this class, you only need to submit submissions from one platform, for example, if you choose the Android platform, you don't need to submit the iOS or web version. 

Let's move on to the next material, namely Flutter installation.
