# Control Flow

## 01. Introduction to Control Flow
Every day we do calculations and comparisons to make decisions, whatever it is. For example, is it necessary to wash the vehicle when the weather is sunny? What online transportation can be ordered when it rains to get to your destination?

</p>

A program also needs to make decisions. In this module we will learn how to give instructions for the computer to make decisions from given conditions as well as how to carry out repeated instructions.

&emsp;
## 02. If - Else
When developing a program, we will meet with a branching path depending on the conditions that occur. To accommodate and check a condition on Dart we use the `if` keyword. 

The `if` expression will test a condition. If the result of the expression evaluates to *true*, the code block in it will be executed. Conversely, if it evaluates to *false* then the specified process will be passed.

```dart
void main() {
  var isRaining = true;
 
  print('Prepare before going to office.');
  if (isRaining) {
    print("Oh. It is raining, bring an umbrella.");
  }
  print('Going to the office.');
}
```

<p align="center" width="100%">
  <img src="https://github.com/DVCone/flutter_course/blob/main/assets/04_b.jpeg" alt="alternate text">
</p>

```bash
> Prepare before going to office.
> Oh. It is raining, bring an umbrella.
> Going to the office.
```

If you change the value of `isRaining` to `false`, then the code inside the `if` block will be skipped and your program won't remind you to bring an umbrella. 

Then what if you want to perform another operation when the condition evaluates to *false*?, The answer is to use `else`. In the following code example we will perform condition checks on comparison operators and logical operators.

```dart
void main() {
  var openHours = 8;
  var closedHours = 21;
  var now = 17;
 
  if (now > openHours && now < closedHours) {
    print("Hello, we're open");
  } else {
    print("Sorry, we’ve closed");
  }
}
```

You can also check multiple conditions at once by combining `else` and `if`. For example, the following value conversion program:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
 
void main() {
  stdout.write('Input your Score (1-100) : ');
  var score = num.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
  
  print('Your Grade is: ${calculateScore(score)}');
}
 
String calculateScore(num score) {
  if (score > 90) {
    return 'A';
  } else if (score > 80) {
    return 'B';
  } else if (score > 70) {
    return 'C';
  } else if (score > 60) {
    return 'D';
  } else {
    return 'E';
  }
}
```

Another interesting feature of Dart is **conditional expressions**. With this we can write an if-else statement in just one line:

```dart
// condition ? true expression : false expression
var shopStatus = now > openHours ? "Hello, we're open" : "Sorry, we've closed";
```

In addition, Dart also supports conditional expressions such as the following:

```dart
expression1 ?? expression2
var buyer = name ?? 'user';
```

### Challenge
In the code above, if the variable `name` is `not null`, the `buyer` will store the value of `name`. However, if the value is `null`, the `buyer` will contain `'user'`. Unlike the previous modules that use *flowcharts*, can you make a program this time or understand the meaning of the following image?

<p align="center" width="100%">
  <img src="https://github.com/DVCone/flutter_course/blob/main/assets/04_c.jpeg" alt="alternate text">
</p>

```dart
void main() {
  int? milk = 10;
  bool? eeg = true;
  
  if (eeg == false) {
    print(milk - 1);
  } else {
    print (milk - 3);
  }
}
```

&emsp;
## 03. For Loops
When writing computer programs, there will be situations where we need to do the same thing over and over again. For example, let's say we want to display all registered usernames in our application, or as simple as displaying the numbers 1 to 10. Of course, it would be impractical to write code like the following:

```dart
print(1);
print(2);
print(3);
print(4);
print(5);
print(6);
print(7);
print(8);
print(9);
print(10);
```

What if we need to display the numbers from 1 to 100? Dart has many options to looping code, one of which is `for`. `For` is suitable for looping conditions where we need an index variable and know how many iterations we need. For example, if we want to display the numbers from 1 to 100, we can write something like this:

```dart
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  print(i);
}
```

More concise right? There are three main parts to the for syntax above:

1. First, the *index* variable which is often named `i` which means *index*. In this variable we initialize the initial value of the loop we are doing. 
2. Second, the comparison operation. In this section the computer will check the condition of whether the loop still needs to be done. If it is `true` then the code inside the `for` block will be executed.
3. Third, *increment/decrement*. Here we add or subtract the index variable. So in the example above the index variable will be added by 1 at the end of each loop.

If written in pseudoCode, then the code above can be interpreted as "If i is less than 100, then run the following code."

### Challenge
Now is the time to test your understanding of  *for loops*. Can you make a Dart program that outputs something like the following?

```dart
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
********
*********
**********
```

```dart
void main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      print(' *');
    }
    print(' ');
  }
}
```

&emsp;
## 04. While & Do-While
Another method for looping is with `while`. Like `for`, the `while` instruction evaluates a *boolean* expression and executes the code inside the `while` block when it evaluates to `true`.

To display the numbers 1 to 10 with while we can write code like this:

```dart
var i = 1;
 
while (i <= 10) {
  print(i);
  i++;
}
```

It can be seen in the code above that the `while` loop doesn't depend on the index variable as in the `for` loop. Therefore, although `while` can perform the same loop as `for`, `while` is more suitable for cases where we are not sure how many iterations are required. Another form of `while` is the `do-while` loop.

```dart
do {
  print(i);
  i++;
} while (i <= 10);
```

The `while` condition will be evaluated before the code block in it is executed, while the `do-while` will evaluate the boolean expression after the code block is executed. This means that the code in the `do-while` will be executed at least once. One common scenario of using `do-while` is in user validation.

```dart
String username;
bool notValid = false;
 
do {
  stdout.write('Enter Your Name (min. 6 Character): ');
  username = stdin.readLineSync() ?? "";
 
  if (username.length < 6 ) {
    notValid = true;
    print('Your Username is not valid');
  }
} while (notValid);
```

In the example above, if the `username` entered by the user is less than 6 characters, then the input is invalid and the user will be asked to enter a username again.

### Infinite Loop
When we apply loops to our programs, there is one condition we need to avoid, which is an infinite loop. **Infinite loop or endless loop** is a condition where our program is stuck in a loop. It will continue until it crashes the application and the computer unless there is external intervention, such as shutting down the application. The following code is an example of where an *infinite loop* condition can occur:

```dart
var i = 1;
 
while (i < 5) {
  print(i);
}
```

Can you figure out what's wrong with the above code that causes the *infinite loop* to occur?, The answer is because the variable `i` always has a value of 1. As a result the condition `i < 5` will always be `true` and as a result the application will continue to print 1 to the console so that it crashes.

### Challenge
Actually the *username input program* above is still incomplete because it has a bug that can cause an infinite loop. Can you find the bug and how to fix it?

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  String username;
  bool notValid = false;
 
  do {
    stdout.write('Enter Your Name (min. 6 Character): ');
    username = stdin.readLineSync() ?? "";
 
    if (username.length <= 6 ) {
      notValid = true;
      print('Your Username is not valid');
    } else {
      break;
    }
  } while (notValid);
}
```

&emsp;
## 05. Break & Continue
You have an application that stores the data of the first 20 prime numbers. Users can search for prime numbers and the computer will display the order in which the numbers are. When the prime number has been found, of course, the computer does not need to continue the iteration process again. Well, this is where we can use `break` to stop and exit the iteration process.

```dart
void main() {
  // 20 First Prime Number
  var primeNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71];
  stdout.write('Enter Prime Number : ');
  var searchNumber = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
 
  for (int i = 0; i < primeNumbers.length; i++) {
    if (searchNumber == primeNumbers[i]) {
      print('$searchNumber is the ${i+1} of Prime Number');
      break;
    }
    print('$searchNumber != ${primeNumbers[i]}');
  }
}

/*
Output :

Enter Prime Number : 13
13 != 2
13 != 3
13 != 5
13 != 7
13 != 11
13 is the 6 of Prime Number

*/
```

Another useful keyword in the loop process is `continue`. With continue we can skip the iteration process and continue to the next iteration process. For example, suppose you want to display the numbers 1 through 10 except for numbers that are multiples of 3. You can write it like this:

```dart
void breakContinue() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i % 3 == 0) {
      continue;
    }
    print(i);
  }
}
 
/*
output :

  1
  2
  4
  5
  7
  8
  10

*/
```

&emsp;
## 06. Switch & Case
Previously we have learned how to condition computer logic by using `if`. However, what if there are multiple conditions that need to be checked using an `if`? Of course it will be confusing and our code will be difficult to read. Dart supports `switch` statements to make checking multiple conditions more easily and concisely.

```dart
switch (variable/expression) {
  case value1:
    // do something
    break;
  case value2:
    // do something
    break;
  ...
  ...
  default:
    // do something else
}
```

The parentheses after the `switch` keyword contain the variable or expression to be evaluated. Then for each condition that may occur we enter the keyword `case` followed by a valid value. If the condition in the case is the same as the variable in the switch, the code block after the colon (`:`) will be executed. The `break` keyword is used to exit the *switch* process. There is one case named `default` which has the same function as the else keyword in the *if-else control flow*. If there is no value equal to the variable on the switch then this code block will be executed.

The following is an example of a calculator application that implements a switch-case.

```dart
stdout.write('Enter the First Number : ');
var firstNumber = num.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
stdout.write('Enter the Operator [ + | - | * | / ] : ');
var operator = stdin.readLineSync();
stdout.write('Enter the Second Number : ');
var secondNumber = num.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
 
switch (operator) {
  case '+':
    print('$firstNumber $operator $secondNumber = ${firstNumber + secondNumber}');
    break;
  case '-':
    print('$firstNumber $operator $secondNumber = ${firstNumber - secondNumber}');
    break;
  case '*':
    print('$firstNumber $operator $secondNumber = ${firstNumber * secondNumber}');
    break;
  case '/':
    print('$firstNumber $operator $secondNumber = ${firstNumber / secondNumber}');
    break;
  default:
    print('Operator Undefined');
}
```

&emsp;
## 07. Summary
In this module we have learned how to write branching program flows based on conditions that occur in the application. Some of the things we have learned include:

1. To accommodate and check a condition can use the if expression. If the result of the expression is true, then the code block in it will be executed. If the condition of the expression evaluates to false, we can use the else expression.
2. Write a branching program flow using an if-else statement

```dart
String calculateScore(num score) {
  if (score > 90) {
    return 'A';
  } else if (score > 80) {
    return 'B';
  } else if (score > 70) {
    return 'C';
  } else if (score > 60) {
    return 'D';
  } else {
    return 'E';
  }
}
```

3. Executing code commands repeatedly can use loops with for, while, or do-while statements. 
4. Write the loop using a for statement so you don't need to write code repeatedly manually.

```dart
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  print(i);
}
```

5. The while and do-while loops are infinite loops or endless loops where the program gets stuck in the loop process that causes an error in the application. 
6. Write looping code using while and do-while statements.

```dart
var i = 1;
 
while (i <= 100) {
  print(i);
  i++;
}
```

7. Use the break keyword in the loop to stop/exit the iteration process. 
8. The continue keyword can be used in the iteration process to skip the iteration process and continue to the next iteration process. 
9. The switch-case statement evaluates a variable/expression with a condition using the equals operator (==). If the value of the variable equals the value of the condition, the code block will be executed.
10. Use the break keyword in the switch-case statement to exit the switch process. 
11. Write branching code with switch-cases for known conditions.

```dart
switch (variable/expression) {
  case value1:
    // do something
    break;
  case value2:
    // do something
    break;
  …
  ...
  default:
    // do something else
}
```
