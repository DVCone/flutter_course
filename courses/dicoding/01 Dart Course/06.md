# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Paradigm of OOP
In the first module we already know that Dart is a language that supports object-oriented programming. OOP is a programming paradigm that is widely used today for developing applications.

The OOP paradigm is based on the concept of objects that have attributes and can perform certain operations or procedures. With OOP, we can easily visualize objects that exist in the real world into computer programs. For example, imagine a cat as an object. This cat object has characteristics such as coat color, cat age, and weight. These characteristics are called *attributes* or *properties*. In addition, cats can also do several things such as eating, sleeping, and playing. The behavior of this cat object is a *method*.

There are 4 (four) pillars in object-oriented programming, including: *encapsulation*, *abstraction*, *inheritance*, and *polymorphism*.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a condition where the state or condition in the `class`, is wrapped and is private. This means that other objects cannot access or change the value of the `property` directly. In the example of the cat case, we cannot directly change the weight of the cat, but we can add it through the function or feeding `method`.

### Abstraction
Abstraction is arguably a natural application of encapsulation. Abstraction means that an object only performs its operations in a *high-level* manner. For example, we know enough about how a cat eats, but we don't need to know what the biological metabolism in a cat's body is that makes her gain weight.

### Inheritance
Some objects can have some characteristics or behavior in common, but they are not the same object. This is where inheritance or inheritance comes into play. Cats have traits and behaviors that are common with other animals, such as having a color, weight, etc. Therefore, the cat as a child object (*subclass*) inherits all the properties and behaviors of its parent object (*superclass*). Likewise, fish objects also inherit the same characteristics and behavior, but fish can swim while cats cannot.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism in Greek means "many forms." Simply put, objects can have different forms or implementations in the same method. All animals breathe, but of course cats and fish have a different way of breathing. The difference in shape or way of breathing is an example of polymorphism.

&emsp;
## 02. Class
One of the main features of OOP is features like **class**. *Class is a blueprint* for creating objects. In this class we define the properties (*attributes*) and *behavior* of the object to be created. For example, the Animal class has attributes such as name, weight, and age, etc. Then the behavior is eating, sleeping, etc.

Each class has *attributes* and *behavior*. In Dart we define *attributes* with variables, while *behavior* is often represented as a *function*.

|attribute        |behavior   |
|-----------------|-----------|
|String name      |eat()      |
|int age          |sleep()    |
|double weight    |poop()     |

To define a class in Dart, just use the keyword `class` followed by the name of the class to be created.

```dart
class Animal {
}
```

Then we can add variables and functions to the class.

```dart
//Animal Class
class Animal {
  //Attribute
  String name;
  int age;
  double weight;
  
  //Object Class
  Animal(this.name, this.age, this.weight);
  
  //Behavior Function
  void eat() {
    print('$name is eating.');
    weight = weight + 0.2;
  }
  
  void sleep() {
    print('$name is sleeping.');
  }

  void poop() {
    print('$name is pooping.');
    weight = weight - 0.1;
  }
}
```

Then to create an object of a class, use the following syntax: `var nameOfObject = NameOfClass(property1, property2);`

An object is like a variable, meaning we can use `var` to initialize an object. Objects stored in this variable are also known as *instances* or *instances of a class*. This *instance* stores the *reference* or memory address of the object. The process of creating an instance variable as above is called *instantiation*.

`var garfieldCat = Animal('Garfield', 2, 4.2);`

We use the class name followed by parentheses. Inside these brackets we can pass parameters to initialize the values ​​in the object. This parenthesis is a *constructor* that we will study in the next material. After the object is created we can run a function or display the value of the *property* in it.

```dart
void main() {
  var garfieldCat = Animal('Garfield', 2, 4.2);
  garfieldCat.eat();
  garfieldCat.poop();
  print(garfieldCat.weight);
}

/* Output :
> Gray is eating.
> Gray is pooping.
> 4.300000000000001
*/
```

&emsp;
## 03. Properties & Methods
We have studied variables for storing values ​​and *functions* for writing reusable instruction sets. Within a class, variables and functions are known as **properties** and **methods**.

As mentioned in the *Class* material, *property* represent the attributes of an object while *methods* describe the behavior of the object. Just like variables, we declare properties in classes by specifying their data type or explicitly initializing their values.

```dart
class Animal {
  String _name = '';
  int _age = 0;
  double _weight = 0;
}
```

OOP has the concept of encapsulation where we can hide information inside an object so that the state or data in the object cannot be changed or even seen. Generally, programming languages ​​have a *visibility modifier* to determine who can access a property or method. However, Dart does not have a *keyword visibility modifier* such as private or public. How to handle it?

Make the class a library and call it with the keyword `import`. To create a class as a library you simply create a new file, so you will have 2 files:

> [Practice on `test/dicoding_test/06_main.dart.dart`]
> [Practice on `test/dicoding_test/06_animal.dart`]

A private property means that it can only be accessed in the same file or library. We will need this private property when we don't want the object to be changed from the outside. Since Dart has no *private modifier*, instead we need to add an underscore (`_`) before the *property* name.

```dart
String _name = '';
int _age = 0;
double _weight = 0;
```

After adding an *underscore* to the variable name, you will get an error in the `main.dart` file when accessing the `weight` property. What's the article? Now `weight` is *private* and cannot be accessed from outside the file. As a workaround, you can add setters and getters to get the values ​​and change them from outside the file. **If using IntelliJ IDEA** you can use the shortcut **Alt + Insert** then **select Getter and Setter**.

```dart
// Setter
set name(String value) {
  _name = value;
}
 
// Getter
double get weight => _weight;
```

In addition to the setter, you can also change the value with the property of the method call. In the `animal class` example, of course, we cannot directly change the weight value, but we can increase and change the value through the process of eating or defecating (poop).

```dart
void eat() {
  print('$_name is eating.');
  _weight = _weight + 0.2;
}
 
void poop() {
  print('$_name is pooping.');
  _weight = _weight - 0.1;
}
```

&emsp;
## 04. Constructor
When an object is created, all properties of that class must have a value. We can directly initialize certain properties or initialize them via **constructor**. A constructor is a special function of a class that is used to create objects.

As the name implies, constructors are used to construct new objects. So why is the constructor called a special function? How is it different from other functions in the class? Some of the differences between constructors and regular functions are:

1. Constructor has the same name as the class name. 
2. Constructor has no return value (return type). 
3. The constructor will be automatically called when an object is created.
4. If we don't define a constructor, a default constructor with no arguments is created.

In the previous material, you indirectly learned to create a constructor that accepts multiple arguments. However, by default a class constructor does not accept any arguments. For example, the Animal class would be like this:

```dart
class Animal {
  String name = '';
  int age = 0;
  double weight = 0;
}
```

To create a new object of the class, you do not need to pass any arguments. `var garfieldCat = Animal();`

Since we did not enter a value when creating the object, the default value of the property or variable will be used. You need to be careful not to assign a value to the property, as this will make the property *null* and could cause an error. To assign a value to a property, please access an existing property in a class.

```dart
var garfieldCat = Animal();
garfieldCat.name = 'Gray';
garfieldCat.age = 2;
garfieldCat.weight = 4.2;
```

By creating a constructor, we can not only initialize values ​​but also execute certain instructions when the object is created.

```dart
Animal(String name, int age, double weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.weight = weight;
  // other instructions
}
```

The `this` keyword above refers to an object in that class. This keyword is generally used to avoid ambiguity between attributes of a class and parameters that have the same name.

If the constructor is only used to initialize property values, then the constructor code can be summarized as follows:

```dart
Animal(this.name, this.age, this.weight);
```

### Named Constructor
In some cases we may need several constructors for different scenarios. In this situation we can use **named constructors**. By using named constructors, we can create multiple constructors in the same class. Each constructor will have a unique name.

```dart
// Formula
class_name.constructor_name (arguments){
  // Statements
}

// Example from 06_animal.dart
Class Animal {
  ...
  Animal.Name(this._name);
  Animal.Age(this._age);
  Animal.Weight(this._weight);
  ...
}
```

&emsp;
## 05. Cascade Notation
Darts are also equipped with a *cascade notation or cascade operator*. This operator allows us to perform several sequences of operations on the same object. We can access the properties of the object and execute the methods on it at the same time when we instantiate the object. Cascade operators are written with two periods (`..` or `?..`). Example :

```dart
void main() {
  var garfieldCat = Animal('', 2, 4.2)
    ..name = 'Garfield'
    ..eat();
}
```

Do you understand the meaning of the code above? We instantiate the Animal object with the constructor as usual. Then the cascade operator that follows will perform operations based on the object returned by the constructor. The sample code does the same thing if we write code like this:

```dart
var garfieldCat = Animal('', 2, 4.2);
garfieldCat.name = 'Gray';
garfieldCat.eat();
```

This cascade operator often saves the step of creating temporary variables, so the code we write becomes more concise.

```dart
Animal('', 2, 4.2)
  ..name = 'Garfield'
  ..eat();
 
 
/* output :
Garfield is eating.
*/
```

Cascade notation will also often be encountered in the `builder pattern` like this:

```dart
final addressBook = (AddressBookBuilder()
      ..name = 'jenny'
      ..email = 'jenny@example.com'
      ..phone = '415-555-0100')
    .build();
```

&emsp;
## 06. Inheritance
Some objects can have some characteristics or behavior in common, but they are not really the same object. Here comes the role of inheritance or inheritance. What is the definition of both? **Inheritance is the ability of a program to create new classes from existing classes.** The concept of inheritance can be imagined as if a child inherits traits from his parents. In OOP the class that inherits the properties is called the *parent class (superclass)* while the class that inherits the parent class is called the *child class (subclass)*.

Let's go back to the cat object example. In addition to cats there are other types of animals that are the same. For example, fish and birds also have names, weights, and ages. In addition they also perform activities such as eating and sleeping. What sets these objects apart is the way they breathe and move. To better understand, consider the following class table:

|cat              |fish             |bird             |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
|name             |name             |name             |
|weight           |weight           |weight           |
|age              |age              |age              |
|**furColor**     |**skinColor**    |**featherColor** |
|                                                     |
|eat()            |eat()            |eat()            |
|sleep()          |sleep()          |sleep()          |
|poop()           |poop()           |poop()           |
|**walk()**       |**swim()**       |**fly()**        |

We can see in the table above that the `Cat`, `Fish`, and `Bird` objects have the same properties and methods such as `name`, `weight`, `age`, `eat()`, and `sleep()`.

1. **parentClass / superClass Structure**

|animal     |
|-----------|
|name       |
|weight     |
|age        |
|           |
|eat()      |
|sleep()    |
|poop()     |


2. **childClass / subClass Structure**

|cat        |fish       |bird             |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
|furColor   |skinColor  |featherColor     |
|walk()     |swim()     |fly()            |

After creating the `Animal` class, we can create another class and then **extend** it to its parent class. To implement *inheritance* use the `extends` keyword as shown in the following example:

```dart
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
 
}
```

That way we can make the `Cat` class inherit the `Animal` class.

> [Practice on `test/dicoding_test/06_animal.dart`]
> [Practice on `test/dicoding_test/06_cat.dart`]

Since the `Cat` class is an instance of the `Animal` class, we can access the properties and behavior of `Animal` through the `Cat` class.

```dart
import 'Cat.dart';
 
void main() {
  var garfieldCat = Cat('Garfield', 2, 2.2, 'Gray');
  garfieldCat.walk();
  garfieldCat.eat();
  print(garfieldCat.weight);
}
 
/*
Output :
  Garfield is walking
  Garfield is eating.
  2.4000000000000004
 */
 ```

 ### Inheritance Constructor
 Since the `Animal` class has a constructor to initialize its properties, all of its child classes also need to implement that constructor. Therefore when creating a `Cat` class without defining a constructor we will get an error. IntelliJ IDEA will provide suggestions for creating a constructor.

 ```dart
 Cat(String name, int age, double weight) : super(name, age, weight);
 ```

 The `super` keyword above will be directed to the constructor of the `Animal` class. If you want to initialize the `furColor` value through the constructor, then we can add a parameter in the constructor.

 ```dart
 Cat(String name, int age, double weight, String furColor) : super(name, age, weight) {
  this.furColor = furColor;
}
```

we can summarize it as we learned in constructor material.

```dart
Cat(String name, int age, double weight, this.furColor) : super(name, age, weight);
```

&emsp;
## 07. Abstract Class
As the name implies, abstract is a general description of a class. It cannot be realized in an object. In the previous module we already had an `Animal` class. Literally animals are a trait. We don't know how the animal object is. We can see the shape of cats, fish, and birds but not for animals. Therefore, the *abstract class* concept needs to be applied so that the `Animal` class cannot be realized in the form of objects but can still pass on its properties to its derived classes.

To make a class abstract, we just need to add the keyword `abstract` before writing the class:

```dart
abstract class Animal {
  String name;
  int age;
  double weight;
 
  // ...
}
```

Thus the `Animal` class cannot be initialized into an object.

```dart
var garfieldCat = Animal('Garfield', 2, 4.2); // Error: The class 'Animal' is abstract and can't be instantiated.
```

&emsp;
## 08. Implicit Interface
In addition to abstract classes, another way we can implement abstractions in OOP is with **interfaces**. Interface or interface is a set of instructions that can be implemented by objects. In general, the interface serves as a liaison between something abstract with something real.

Imagine the TV remote or the buttons on your cellphone. These buttons we can call the interface. We don't need to know and care about how it functions.

Dart does not have keywords or syntax to declare interfaces like other OOP programming languages. Each class in Dart can act as an interface. Therefore the interface in Dart is known as an **implicit interface**. To implement an interface, use the `implements` keyword. We can implement multiple interfaces at once in one class.

`class ClassName implements InterfaceName`

After the class implements the interface, the class must implement all the methods in the interface. For example we create a new class called `Flyable` which will act as an interface.

```dart
class Flyable {
  void fly() { }
}
```

We can leave the body of the `fly()` method empty because the implementation function will be carried out by the `class`. Next, create a new class that implements the `Flyable` interface.

```dart
class Bird extends Animal implements Flyable {
  String featherColor;
 
  Bird(String name, int age, double weight, this.featherColor) : super(name, age, weight);
 
}
```

You will get an error that gives the message *“Missing concrete implementation of Flyable.fly”*. This means that we have to implement the `fly` function contained in the `Flyable` interface.

```dart
class Bird extends Animal implements Flyable {
  String featherColor;
 
  Bird(String name, int age, double weight, this.featherColor) : super(name, age, weight);
 
  @override
  void fly() {
    print('$name is flying');
  }
 
}
```

The `@override` keyword or annotation indicates that the function overrides a function in the interface or its parent class, and uses a function in the class itself instead.

&emsp;
## 09. Enumerated Types
How can we store multiple constant values ​​in one place and handle them at the same time? The solution, Dart provides **Enums**. Enums represent a collection of constants that make our code clearer and easier to read.

```dart
enum Rainbow {
  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet
}
 
enum Status {
  Todo, In_Progress, In_Review, Done
}
```

Dart's enum has several built-in *properties* that we can use to display all values ​​in the form of a list and display the item and index of that item.

```dart
print(Rainbow.values);
print(Rainbow.blue);
print(Rainbow.orange.index);

/* Output :
> [Rainbow.red, Rainbow.orange, Rainbow.yellow, Rainbow.green, Rainbow.blue, Rainbow.indigo, Rainbow.violet]
> Rainbow.blue
> 1
*/
```
We can also use `enum` into `switch` statements. However we need to handle all possible Existing enum values.

```dart
var taskStatus = Status.In_Progress;
 
switch(taskStatus) {
  case Status.Todo:
    print('Task is still in To do');
    break;
  case Status.In_Progress:
    print('Task is in progress');
    break;
  case Status.In_Review:
    print('Task is currently under review');
    break;
  case Status.Done:
    print('Task is done');
    break;
}
```

&emsp;
## 10. Mixin
**Mixin** are a way of reusing class code in multiple class hierarchies. The concept of mixins may be new to you because they don't exist in C# or Java. So why and when do we need to use mixins? We return to the animal example. Look at the following diagram:

<p align="center" width="100%">
  <img src="https://github.com/DVCone/flutter_course/blob/main/assets/06_a.jpeg" alt="alternate text">
</p>

We have a `superclass Animal` with `three subclasses`. Beneath it are several derived classes that have different behaviors. Some animals have the same behavior, such as the Cat and Duck both can walk. We can create classes like `Walkable`, `Swimmable`, and `Flyable`. Unfortunately, Dart does not support multiple inheritance, so a class can only inherit one parent class. We can just create an interface and then implement it into the `Cat` or `Duck` class. However, interface implementation requires us to override methods and create function implementations in each class.

```dart
mixin Flyable {
  void fly() {
    print("I'm flying");
  }
}
 
mixin Walkable {
  void walk() {
    print("I'm walking");
  }
}
 
mixin Swimmable {
  void swim() {
    print("I'm swimming");
  }
}
```

Mixin classes can be defined with the `class` keyword just like any other class. If you don't want the class to act like a regular class for example like it can be instantiated into an object, just use the `mixin` keyword. After creating a class as above we can add it as a mixin with the keyword `with` and followed by one or more mixin classes.

```dart
class Cat extends Mammal with Walkable { }
 
class Duck extends Bird with Walkable, Flyable, Swimmable { }
```

This mixin allows the `cat` object to call the `walk()` method. Meanwhile, the `duck` object can call the `walk()`, `fly()`, and `swim()` methods.

```dart
void main() {
  var donald = Duck();
  var garfield = Cat();
 
  garfield.walk();
 
  donald.walk();
  donald.swim();
}
```

If you pay attention, this mixin is indeed similar to multiple inheritance. However, this mixin class does not belong to the parent-child or inheritance hierarchy. Therefore, mixins allow us to avoid the problem that often occurs in multiple inheritance known as the `diamond problem`, where there are two parent classes that have methods with the same name so that the child class is ambiguous in which method to run.

For example we have a class called `Performer`.

```dart
abstract class Performer {
  void perform();
}
```

Then we have two inherited classes of `Performer`.

```dart
class Dancer extends Performer {
  @override
  void perform() {
    print('Dancing');
  }
}
 
class Singer extends Performer {
  @override
  void perform() {
    print('Singing');
  }
}
```

We assume Dart has support for *multiple inheritance* so we have 1 more class like this:

```dart
class Musician extends Dancer, Singer {
  void showTime() {
    perform();
  }
}
```

Which `perform()` method will be executed? Luckily with Dart we can avoid situations like this with `mixin`. When mixing classes, the classes that are used as mixins are not parallel but stacked on top of each other. That's why the classes or methods in a mixin are not ambiguous to each other. Because of that, order is important when implementing mixins. Let's say we've implemented a mixin on the `Musician` class.

```dart
mixin Dancer implements Performer {
  @override
  void perform() {
    print('Dancing');
  }
}
 
mixin Singer implements Performer {
  @override
  void perform() {
    print('Singing');
  }
}
 
class Musician extends Performer with Dancer, Singer {
  void showTime() {
    perform();
  }
}
```

Then create an object that will execute the `perform()` method.

Try running the main function above, what will appear on the console? Why is that? As already explained, mixin classes are stacked. These classes are in order from the most general to the most specific. So that according to the mixin order above, the `Musician` class will display the method from `Singer` because it is in the last or most specific order.
