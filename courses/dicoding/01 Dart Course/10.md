# Effective Dart

## 01. Introduction to Effective Dart
We have finally arrived at the last module in our Getting Started Programming with Darts class. Basically as a programmer, especially working in a team, the majority of our time will be spent reading code rather than writing it. That's what the coding convention is for . Coding conventions are guides for specific programming languages ​​that recommend programming styles, practices, and methods for every aspect of programs written in that language. These conventions usually include indents, comments, declarations, naming, architecture, etc.

Code conventions are very important to programmers for the following reasons:

1. 40% - 80% of the cost of a software used for maintenance ( maintenance ).
2. It is very rare for a piece of software to be maintained on an ongoing basis by its original author.
3. Code conventions improve code readability, allowing programmers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.
4. Source code is more organized and clean as a product.

Dart has also developed coding conventions that aim to allow us to write consistent, robust, and fast code. This Convention Dart is known as the Effective Dart. In essence Effective Dart was created to achieve two things:

1. **Be consistent** (Consistent). When it comes to formatting there will be many subjective arguments about which one is better. But consistency will certainly be very helpful objectively.
2. **Be brief** . Dart is designed to be familiar with other programming languages ​​such as C, Java, JavaScript, etc. But Dart is coupled with other features that other languages ​​don't offer yet. If there are many ways to express something, of course you will use the most concise way, right?
