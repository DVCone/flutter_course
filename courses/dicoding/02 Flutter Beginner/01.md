# Flutter Introduction

## 01. Flutter Framework
Technology has become an inseparable part of our lives, especially smartphones . According to data from We Are Social , in January 2020 internet users in Indonesia reached around 175.4 million people. There is an increase of 17% or around 25 million users from 2019. If you look at the total population of Indonesia which is around 272.1 million people, then 64% of them have access to the internet. With the massive number of smartphone users, the requirements for an application developer are becoming more specific . Including requirements on mobile devices targeting Android and iOS platforms. Each platform has an application it's own native .

Developing two platforms has many implications. From a business perspective, the costs that need to be incurred are certainly not cheap. Two apps means there are two types of developers to hire and two types of development to manage. If there is a technology that allows application development on several platforms at once with only one codebase, it's certainly more economical, right? Definitely more efficient in terms of cost, time, and energy.

Interested in studying the technology stack that can make it happen? Let's get acquainted with Flutter. This is a popular and powerful framework made by Google, Flutter is here to develop multi-platform applications that are compiled natively.

&emsp;
## 02. What is Flutter
Flutter is an SDK ( Software Development Kit ) developed by Google to create good applications that can run on multiple platforms. Flutter 2 which is the latest version provides support for you to build applications on Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux, and MacOS operating systems. With this, you only need to code once or known as a single codebase . Flutter has also been used by many developers and organizations around the world, besides Flutter is open source .

### Why Flutter
Flutter is different from most other Cross-platform SDKs for building mobile apps . To draw widgets , Flutter uses neither a WebView nor OEM widgets , but a high-performance rendering engine. Flutter can be used in conjunction with existing native apps or used in its entirety for new apps. 

There are several advantages of Flutter, including:

1. **Flutter allows us to create beautiful applications (beautiful)**
Designers can freely create without the many limitations of the framework . Flutter can also control every pixel on the screen, making it easier to create animations. Flutter provides many material design components that work well on Android, iOS, and the web.

2. **Flutter runs very fast**
Flutter uses a graphic engine called Skia-2D which is also used on Chrome and Android. Flutter code uses the Dart language, which allows it to be compiled to native 32-bit and 64-bit ARM code for iOS and Android.

3. **Flutter is very productive**
Flutter has a hot-reload feature that allows you to view compilation results in real-time . With hot-reload , you can easily see code changes on your device, without waiting for a restart and losing state 

4. **Flutter is open source**
Flutter is an open source project with a BSD license. The code in Flutter comes from contributions from hundreds of developers from around the world. Many plugins have been made by developers. You can contribute to the development of Flutter by reporting bugs/issues or helping improve existing code. You can find the source code for Flutter at `https://github.com/flutter/flutter`.

### Flutter Development History
The first version of Flutter named Sky was announced at the 2015 Dart Developer Summit. At that time, Sky only ran on the Android operating system. 

Then, on Google Developer Days in Shanghai, Google announced the Release Preview version of Flutter 2 which was a release before the stable 1.0 version.

On March 3, 2021 yesterday, Flutter announced a version of Flutter 2 with a fairly major update, namely Flutter support for web and desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS) which entered the stable version .

Since the release of the first beta, Flutter has been widely used to develop mobile applications . Examples are Abbey Road Studios, Alibaba, Capital One, Groupon, Hamilton, JD.com, Philips Hue, Reflectly, Tencent, and GITS Indonesia.

### Dart
As we already know, Flutter application is written in Dart language. You should have learned about Darts fundamentals in the Getting Started Programming with Darts class . To refresh your memory we will review a little about Dart.

Dart programming language is a general-purpose programming language designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund. This programming language was developed as an application programming language that can be easily learned and deployed.

This programming language made by Google can be used to develop various platforms including the web, mobile applications, servers, and devices that carry Internet of Things (IoT) technology.

This programming language can be used to develop applications that run on a variety of modern browsers. Dart can also be used to develop applications from a single codebase into Android and iOS applications.

The Dart programming language can be used freely by developers because it is released open-source by Google under the BSD license. Dart programming language is a class-based and object-oriented programming language using the C programming language Syntax .

This language was introduced by Google as a replacement for the JavaScript programming language, but optionally it can be compiled into JavaScript using the Dart-to-JavaScript compiler . Slightly different from the dynamic type JavaScript programming language, the Dart programming language is a static type programming language.

Okay, so far we have learned about what Flutter is, including its history and why we need to learn to develop applications with Flutter. In this class you will learn the basics of developing Flutter applications, such as packages , commonly used widgets , how to move pages using Navigation, to the process of building into APKs that can be installed on your smartphone.

> Note: The material in this class will be delivered in many options, ranging from the operating system (OS), Android or iOS platform, and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Please adjust it according to your hardware/software specifications and skip material that you feel is not needed. 

To pass this class, you only need to submit submissions from one platform, for example, if you choose the Android platform, you don't need to submit the iOS or web version. 

Let's move on to the next material, namely Flutter installation. 

&emsp;
## 03. Flutter Installation
Before starting to develop applications using Flutter, of course, we need to prepare and install any tools needed to create Flutter applications. To install Flutter, there are different ways in each operating system. Check out the following method according to the operating system you are using:

### Minimum Requirement
Before installing and running Flutter, your device must meet the minimum requirements as below:

#### Windows
1. Operating System: Windows 7 SP1 or later (64-bit).
2. Storage Space: 1.64 GB and does not include IDE and other tools.
3. Flutter depends on the tools in the environment:
      1. Windows Powershell 5.0 or the latest version (already included in the Windows 10 installation package), you can download at the following link `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-windows-powershell`.
      2. Git for Windows 2.x, with the option "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt", you can download at the following link `https://git-scm.com/download/win`.

If Git for Windows is already installed, make sure you can run git commands from Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell.

#### MacOs
1. Operating System: Mac OS 64-bit.
2. Storage space: 2.8 GB and does not include IDE and other tools.
3. Flutter depends on these command-line tools available in the environment:
      1. bash
      2. curl
      3. git 2.x
      4. Mkdir 
      5. rm
      6. unzip
      7. which

#### Linux
1. Operating System: 64-bit Linux.
2. Storage space: 1.8 GB and does not include IDE and other tools.
3. Flutter depends on these command-line tools available in the environment:
      1. bash
      2. curl
      3. git 2.x
      4. mkdir
      5. rm
      6. unzip
      7. which
      8. xz-utils
4. Shared Libraries : The test command in Flutter depends on the libraries available in the environment.
      1. libGLU.so.1 - provided by mesa packages such as, libglu1-mesa on Ubuntu/Debian.

### Flutter SDK Installation
Once the minimum requirements are met, you can start installing the Flutter SDK. The way to get the Flutter SDK is as follows:

#### Windows
1. Download the installation package to get the latest stable version of the Flutter SDK at the web address `https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases`. Download the latest version on the stable channel according to the operating system used.
2. Extract the zip file and place the flutter folder in the desired installation location for the Flutter SDK. For example C:\Development, don't install Flutter in a directory like C:\Program Files or one that requires administrator privileges.
3. Find the flutter_console.bat file in the flutter directory. Start by double-clicking or running the script and you are now ready to run Flutter commands in the Flutter Console.

#### MacOS & Linux
1. Download the installation package to get the latest stable version of Flutter SDK at the web address https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases , grab the latest version on the stable channel according to the operating system used.
2. Extract the zip file and place the flutter folder in the desired installation location for the Flutter SDK. For example ~/development.
3. Add Flutter Tools to your PATH.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:~/development/flutter/bin"
```

### Path Update
The next step is to update the path so that the Flutter command can be used at the command prompt/terminal. Here are the steps:

#### Windows
1. From the search bar in the Start menu, type 'env' and select Edit Environment Variable for your account.
2. Click on the Environment Variables button.
3. Under User variable check if there is an entry called PATH, if there is then select it then edit, if not there then create a new one with variable name Path.
4. Edit or add the values ​​with the Flutter SDK directory.
      1. If there is an entry, add the full path to flutter\bin using a semicolon (;) as a separator from the existing values ​​(if using single-line edit mode).
      2. If the entry is not found, create a new user variable and name it Path and set flutter\bin as its value.

Note that you must close and reopen all existing console windows for the changes to take effect.

#### MacOS & Linux
You can update the PATH variable, only for the current (temporary) command-line session. You may want to permanently update the variable, so that it can run flutter commands in any terminal session.

The steps to permanently modify the PATH variable for all terminal sessions will depend on the device used. Generally, you can add a PATH variable like this:
1. Specify the directory where you put the Flutter SDK. You will need it in step 3 of this example.
2. Open (or create) $HOME/.bash_profile . The directory and filename may be different on your device (could be .profile, .bash_profile, .zshrc, .bashrc, or something else).
3. Add the following line and change [FLUTTER_DIRECTORY] to the directory where you put the Flutter SDK:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:[FLUTTER_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin"
```

4. Run source $HOME/.bash_profile to reload the current terminal.
5. Make sure the flutter/bin directory is now in your PATH by running the command :

```bash
echo $PATH
```

### Flutter Doctor
Flutter doctor is a command to check the completeness of the flutter framework you are using, such as the flutter version you are using, the Android SDK you are using, the iOS SDK you are using (only on MacOS), the devices you are connected to, and so on. Double check and make sure the dependencies for the setup are complete. Run the following command to open flutter doctor:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your environment and displays the report to a terminal window. The Flutter SDK already includes the Dart SDK, so you don't need to install Dart separately. Check the output carefully for other software that you may need to install or do something further (shown in bold text).

```bash
[-] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices

• Android SDK at D:\Android\sdk

**✗ Android SDK is missing command line tools; download from https://goo.gl/XxQghQ**

• Try re-installing or updating your Android SDK,

    visit https://flutter.io/setup/#android-setup for detailed instructions.
```

This section describes how to complete the Flutter SDK installation process. After installing the missing dependencies, run the flutter doctor command again to verify that you have everything set up correctly.

&emsp;
## 04. IDE Installation
You can build applications with Flutter using a text editor in combination with command-line tools . However, we recommend using one of the recommended editor plugins for a better experience. This plugin has features like code completion, syntax highlighting, widget editing help , support for run & debug, and much more.

Installing Android Studio is necessary to build Android apps with Flutter, but the alternative is to install the Java SDK and the Android SDK itself.

If you already have Android Studio installed, it is recommended not to install Java separately and other Android environments such as ANDROID_HOME or ANDROID_SDK_ROOT . If it's already installed and an android licenses error occurs in Flutter Doctor, try uninstalling the Java package.

Follow the steps below to add editor plugins for Android Studio, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio Code.

### VSCode
Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a lightweight editor for combining command line especially Flutter applications and includes debugging support. 

To download Visual Studio Code, visit the link https://code.visualstudio.com/download .

Here's how to install Flutter and Dart plugins in VSCode:
1. Open the pre-installed Visual Studio Code application.
2. Then activate the Command Line by selecting **View > Command Palette…**
3. Type “ **Install** ” then select **Extensions: Install Extensions**.
4. Or directly click on the **Extensions** tab on the left.
5. Type “ **Flutter** ” in the Extensions search field, and select Flutter in the list of available extensions. Then click the **Install** button . The Dart plugin will also be installed automatically.
6. Click **Reload** to Activate  to reload VSCode.

Once done, validate the Flutter plugin in VSCode in the following way:

1. Activate the Command Line by selecting **View>Command Palette...**
2. Type “ **doctor** ”, then select Flutter: Run Flutter Doctor.
3. Review the OUTPUT panel for any issues.

### XCode + Simulator Installation
To run Flutter apps on iOS, you need to install XCode first. XCode is an IDE used to develop and deploy iOS applications.

All you have to do to develop an iOS app using Flutter is: 

1. Download XCode, you can download it directly from the AppStore.
2. Open a terminal and enter the command below: This command will ensure that the command-line tools operation in XCode will use the latest version.

```bash
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
```

3. Finally, sign the XCode license agreement by opening XCode and confirming. Or you can also sign using the terminal and run this command:

```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license
```

Also make sure to always download and update your version of XCode, as Flutter does not support older versions of XCode.

> Note: Please note that the XCode here is only needed for the debugging and deployment process. For now, it cannot be used for editing the Flutter application program code in XCode.

So if you want to develop iOS apps using Flutter, what is recommended is:

1. Installing Android Studio or Visual Studio Code.
2. Fixed XCode installation.
3. Edit the program code in Android Studio or Visual Studio Code.
4. Run the app using Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, or terminal/cmd.

&emsp;
## 05. Project Wizard
After successfully installing the Flutter SDK and IDE, it means that the tools we need are ready. This section will explain the steps for creating a new Flutter app, starting with templates, how to use the app, and using "Hot Reload" after you make changes to your app code.

Choose your favorite development tool (IDE) to write command line, build, and run Flutter applications.

### VSCode
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Activate the Command Line by clicking **View>Command Palette...**
3. Type “**Flutter**” then select **Flutter: New Project.**
4. Enter **the project name** , and press **Enter**.
5. Create or select a directory for the new project folder.
6. Wait a few moments for VSCode to finish setting up the project.

### Terminal & Editor
1. Open Terminal/CMD.
2. Use the flutter create command to create a new project.

```bash
flutter create dicoding
cd coded
```

The above command creates a Flutter project directory containing a simple demonstration application using Material Components.

> Tip : The Dart code for your app is in lib/main.dart. For a more detailed description of what each code block does, see the comments included in the file.
