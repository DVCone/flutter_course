# Functional Style

## Paradigm of Functional Style
As stated earlier, Dart is a language that supports multi-paradigms. This means that apart from being an object-oriented programming language, Dart's syntax also uses a functional programming style.

*Functional programming* is a programming paradigm in which the computational process is based on pure mathematical functions. Functional programming (FP) is written in a declarative style that focuses on “what to solve” rather than “how to solve” in an imperative style.

### Pure Functions
Pure functions means a function depends on the arguments or parameters passed to it. So a function call with the same argument value will always give the same result. For example, in the `sum()` function, the value returned will depend on the arguments given.

```dart
int sum(int num1, int num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

### Recursion
In functional programming, there is no loop concept like `for` or `while`. Iteration in functional programming is done through recursion or function calls from the function itself, until it reaches the base case.

```dart
int fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return 0;
  } else if(n == 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
}
```

### Immutable Variables
Variables in functional programming are immutable, meaning that we cannot change a variable once it is initialized. Instead of changing the value of a variable, we can create a new variable to store data. This mechanism aims to make our code more secure because the state of the application will not change as long as the application is running.

```dart
var x = 5; // immutable variable 
x = x + 1; // non-immutable variable
```

> Functions are first-class citizen and can be higher-order

The point of a function being a first-class citizen is that it behaves like any other programming component. A function can be passed to a variable as a parameter in a function and also as a return value in a function. *Higher order functions* are functions that take other functions as arguments and can also return functions.
