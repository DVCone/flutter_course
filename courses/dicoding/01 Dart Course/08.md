# Dart Type Systems

## 01. Introduction of Dart Type System
In programming languages, a type system is a logical system consisting of a set of rules that assign properties or types to various computer program constructs, such as variables, expressions , functions, or modules. This type system formalizes or provides implied category standards that programmers use for data types, data structures, or other components.

Dart calls his type system a **sound type system** . This soundness means your program can never enter a state where an expression evaluates to a value that doesn't match its type.

The sound type system in Dart is the same as the type system in Java or C#. Where this soundness condition is achieved using a combination of static checks ( compile-time error ) and runtime checks . For example, assigning a `String` to an `int` variable is a compile-time error . Casting `Object` to `String` with as `String` will fail at runtime if the object is not `String`.

The benefits of this type of sound system include:

1. Revealed type-related bugs at compile time .
      The sound type system forces code to be unambiguous about the type, so type-related bugs that might be difficult to spot at runtime can be found at compile time.
2. Code is easier to read.
      Code becomes easier to read because you can rely on values ​​that actually have the specified type. The type on Dart can't lie.
3. Code is easier to manage.
      When you change a piece of code, the type system can warn you about which part of the code was recently broken.
4. Better ahead of time (AOT) compilation .
      Code generated during AOT compilation is much more efficient.

## 02. Generic
If you look at the documentation for collections such as `List` , the actual type of List is `List<E>` . This `<...>` sign indicates that List is a generic type, a type that has parameter types. According to Dart's coding convention , parameter types are denoted by a single capital letter such as `E` , `T` , `K` , or `V` .

In general, generic is a concept used to determine the type of data that we will use. We can replace the generic parameter type in Dart with a more specific type by specifying an instance of that type.

For example, consider a `List` that stores the following values: `List<int> numberList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`

The parameter type used in the list variable above is `int` , so the value we can enter is a value of type `int` . Likewise, if we specify the parameter type String , then the type that we can enter into the list is only a `String`.

```dart
List<int> numberList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
List<String> stringList = ['Dart', 'Flutter', 'Android', 'iOS'];
List dynamicList = [1, 2, 3, 'four'];  // List<dynamic>
```

It's different if we don't specify the parameter type of the list . The list does not have a type that the compiler refers to so all types can be stored in a list. The `dynamicList` variable above actually still applies generic with `dynamic` type so its type becomes `List<dynamic>`.

From the above case we can conclude that Dart helps us to generate type safe code by limiting the types that can be used in an object and avoiding bugs . In addition, generic is also useful to reduce code duplication. For example when you need to `cache` objects of type String and int . Instead of creating two `StringCache` and `IntCache` objects , you can create just one object by using the parameter type from generic .

```dart
abstract class Cache<T> {
  T getByKey(String key);
  void setByKey(String key, T value);
}
```

With the Dart type system , we can change the type of parameters used according to the hierarchical arrangement. Consider the following hierarchy of Animal objects:

</p>

With the above hierarchy, if we have a `List<Bird>` object, what objects can we add to the list ?

`List<Bird> birdList = [Bird(), Dove(), Duck()];`

All `Bird` objects or their child objects can be included in a `birdList` . However, when adding an object from `Animal` , a compile error occurs because the `Animal` object is not necessarily a `Bird` object .

`List<Bird> birdList = [Bird(), Dove(), Duck(), Animal()];  // Error`

It's different if we fill `List<Bird>` with `List<Animal>` like this:

```dart
List<Bird> myBird = List<Animal>();

// The compiler will show no errors but when the code is run it will runtime error because List<Animal> is not a subtype of List<BIrd>.

/* Output :
> Unhandled exception:
> type 'List<Animal>' is not a subtype of type 'List<Bird>'
*/
```

&emsp;
## 03. Type Inference
As we know Dart supports type inference . Dart has an analyzer that can define inferring types for fields , methods , local variables, and some generic argument types . When the analyzer does not have sufficient information to conclude a particular type, the `dynamic` type is used.

For example, the following is an example of writing a map variable with an explicit type:

```dart
Map<String, dynamic> company = {'name': 'SpaceX', 'yearsFounded': 2002};

// Alternative with Var
var company = {'name': 'SpaceX', 'yearsFounded': 2002}; // Map<String, Object>
```

Type inference determines the type of the entry and then determines the type of the variable. In the example above, the two keys of map are `String` , but the values ​​are of different types, namely `String` and `int`, both of which are instances of `Object`. So the `company` variable will be of type `Map<String, Object>`.

When assigning an object's value to another object, we can replace its type with a different type depending on whether the object is a consumer or producer . Pay attention to the following assignments : 

`Fish fish = Fish();`

`Fish fish` is the consumer and `Fish()` is the producer . In the consumer position , it is safe to replace a specific type of consumer with a more general type. So, it's safe to replace `Fish fish` with `Animal fish` because `Animal` is a *supertype* of `Fish`.

`Animal fish =Fish();`

However, replacing `Fish fish` with `Shark fish` violates type safety because `Fish` may have other subtypes with different behavior, for example `FlyingFish`.

`Shark fish =Fish();// Error`

In the producer 's position , it is safe to replace the general type ( supertype ) with a more specific type ( subtype ).

`Fish fish =Shark();`

## 04. Summary
You are at the end of the Dart Type System module . Let's break down the material you've studied to sharpen your understanding.

1. A type system is a set of rules that assign properties or types to various computer program constructs, such as variables, expressions , functions, or modules.
2. This type system provides implied category standards that programmers use for data types, data structures, or other components.
3. Dart has a type system with a sound type system with the intention that the program will always evaluate values ​​that do not match the type.
4. The benefits of having a sound type system on the Dart are :
      1. Found a bug related to data types at compile time .
      2. Code is easier to read.
      3. Code is easier to manage.
      4. Better ahead of time (AOT) compilation.
5. Generic understanding in general is a concept used to determine the type of data to be used.
6. The benefits of Generic on Darts are:
      1. Type safety, meaning that the object will limit the types that can be used in the object.
      2. Reduce code duplication so that it is easier to create new interfaces .
7. Dart supports type inference, which has an analyzer that can infer types for fields , methods , local variables, and several other generic argument types .
