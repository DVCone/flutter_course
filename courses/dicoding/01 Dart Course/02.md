# Your First Dart Program

## 01. Prepare tools and software
In this module we'll start setting up what tools are needed to get our first Dart app up and running.

Each tool that will be used aims to enable us to develop Dart applications locally on our laptops or computers. However, if you want to do it online, you can take advantage of DartPad. A tool that lets you write and run Dart code in a browser window. You can access this DartPad at the link `https://dartpad.dev/`.

&emsp;
## 02. Dart SDK Installation
To be able to run Dart on a local device, we need to install the Dart SDK. The Dart SDK is a collection of *libraries* and *command-line* tools needed to develop web, command-line, and server applications using Dart. For mobile application development, you can directly use the Flutter SDK which includes the Dart SDK in it.

Dart has three release versions, namely *stable, beta and dev*. Stable releases are stable versions of the Dart SDK and are usually updated every 3 months or so. The beta channel is a preview release version and is usually updated every month, while the dev channel is a pre-release version which is usually updated twice a week.

You can choose to use the beta and dev versions if you want to get early access to new features and fixes. You can install the Dart SDK according to the operating system you are using.

&emsp;
### Windows
If you are using the Windows operating system, you can download the Dart SDK at the following link: `https://www.gekorm.com/dart-windows`. You can choose to use the *stable* or *dev* version of the Dart SDK. Once downloaded, double click the file and follow the installation steps.

&emsp;
### Linux
For linux users, you can install the Dart SDK via the terminal with the **apt-get command**. 

Run the following command to **set up the Dart SDK**
```bash
> sudo apt-get update

> sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

> sudo sh -c 'wget -qO- https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add -'

> sudo sh -c 'wget -qO- https://storage.googleapis.com/download.dartlang.org/linux/debian/dart_stable.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dart_stable.list'
```

Then run the following command to **install the stable version** of Dart SDK:
```bash
> sudo apt-get update

> sudo apt-get install dart
```

If you want to **install the dev version**, use the following command:
```bash
> sudo sh -c 'wget -qO- https://storage.googleapis.com/download.dartlang.org/linux/debian/dart_unstable.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dart_unstable.list'

> sudo apt-get update

> sudo apt-get install dart
```

Next we need to **add the bin folder** from the Dart SDK that has been installed to the PATH environment. How to run the following command:
```bash
> echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin"' >> ~/.profile
```

&emsp;
### MacOS
For Mac, you can install the Dart SDK using Homebrew: `https://brew.sh/`. 

Run the following command:
```zsh
> brew tap dart-lang/dart

> brew install dart
```

If you want to **use the dev version**, add the `--devel` command:
```zsh
> brew install dart -- --devel
```

&emsp;
## 03. IDE Installation
Dart is a flexible language with a lot of supporting tools. Starting from DartPad where you can experiment with Dart features online without needing to download any software.

But if you have a need to save your project and work on it locally, using a text editor or *Integrated Development Environment* (IDE) is a good option. You can use Dart in popular IDEs such as Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code by taking advantage of the provided plugins. In addition, the Dart plugin can also be used in editors such as Emacs, Atom Vim, and Eclipse.

For convenience and increase productivity in developing applications, we will use the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. This IDE has several features that really help us as developers such as code suggestions, shortcuts, version control, etc.

Before installing IntelliJ IDEA, first know some of the requirements in each operating system as follows:

### Windows
1. Microsoft Windows 10/8/7/Vista/2003/XP (incl.64-bit) 
2. 2 GB RAM minimum, 4 GB RAM recommended 
3. 1.5 GB free space on storage 
4. 1024x768 minimum screen resolution

### Linux
1. GNOME or KDE desktop 
2. 2GB RAM minimum, 4GB RAM recommended 
3. 1.5 GB free space on storage 
4. 1024x768 minimum screen resolution

### MacOS
1. macOS 10.8.3 or higher 
2. 2 GB RAM minimum, 4 GB RAM recommended 
3. 1.5 GB free space on storage 
4. 1024x768 minimum screen resolution

Make sure your computer meets the requirements above. If so, download the IntelliJ IDEA installation file based on the operating system used at `https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/`. 

You can download the Community version for license use for free. Then follow the installation steps according to the operating system you are using.

### Linux
After successfully downloading the file, extract the file using the following command in the terminal:
```bash
> tar xvf <nama-file>.tar.gz
```
Then, go to the bin folder by using the command:
```bash
> cd <name-file>/bin/
```
Finally, run the idea.sh shell script using the command:
```bash
> ./idea.sh
```

### Windows & MacOS
Unlike Linux, if you're using Windows or macOS, you don't need to extract the download. You can directly run the *idealC-2019.3.2.exe* (Windows) or *idealC-2019.3.2.dmg*(macOS) files. 

Then follow the instructions in the window that appears to complete the installation process.


### Integrated IDE to Dart SDK
After the IntelliJ IDEA installation process is complete, the next step we need to add the Dart plugin so that we can use it to create a Dart project. How to click Plugins, then on the Marketplace tab find the Dart plugin and click Install.

Once the plugin is installed, you need to restart the IDE. 

Congratulation! You are ready to build applications with Dart. To start creating a project, click Create New Project. You need to enter the directory from where you installed the Dart SDK. If you are a Linux and macOS user, your SDK will usually be located in the /usr/lib/dart directory.

&emsp;
## 04. Create First Program
Once all the equipment is installed, you are ready to create a Dart program. It is a tradition in every programming language learning that the first application made to start a language is to display the words "Hello, World!"

1. Let's start by opening Intellij IDEA.
2. Click **New Project**. 
3. Select **Dart** and enter the Dart SDK path.
4. Use the **Application Console** template. Then click **Next**. 
5. Enter the project name and the *location of the project* will be saved. For example, we give the name of *learning darts* (we should use **lowercase** letters).
6. If you have done, click the **Finish** button. 
7. IntelliJ IDEA will save the Dart project. Once ready, you can write your program code to the `learn_dart.dart` file located in the bin folder.
8. In the `learn_dart.dart` file there is code that we can run immediately.

```dart
import 'package:Learn_Dart/Learn_Dart.dart' as Learn_Dart;

void main(List<String> arguments) {
  print('Hello world: ${Learn_Dart.calculate()}!');
}
```

To run the application on IntelliJ IDEA, click the green triangle icon on the top menu or with the shortcut **Shift + F10**. 

**Note:** If the Run icon or green triangle does not appear, you can add configuration manually by clicking Add Configuration. Click the + button then select Dart Command Line App. Next on the Dart file select the Dart file to run, then click OK.

The Dart Console will display text like the following: `Hello world: 42!`.

Congratulation! You have successfully created and run the Hello World program with Dart. But do you know how the application runs and can display output like on the console?

&emsp;
## 05. Summary
In this module, we have seen how to get started programming with Darts. Let's break down what we've learned in this module:
1. The Dart SDK is a collection of libraries and command-line tools needed when developing applications that use the Dart language.
2. Dart has three release versions, including:
      1. stable, updated every 3 months. 
      2. beta, usually updated monthly. 
      3. dev, usually updated twice a week.
3. There are tools that are able to develop Dart applications online, namely DartPad (browser). 
4. Several text editors or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can save and run Dart projects locally, include Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and Visual Studio Code. 
5. The Dart plugin can be used in several other text editors such as Emacs, Atom, Vim, and Eclipse.
6. There are several shortcuts that can be more productive when writing code in the IntelliJ IDEA text editor, including:
      1. Shift + F10 to run the application. 
      2. Ctrl + Alt + L to tidy up the code structure so that it is neatly organized.

Next, we'll start discussing the fundamentals of programming with Dart, such as variables, data types, functions, etc. See you in the next module.
