# Effective Dart

## 01. Introduction to Effective Dart
We have finally arrived at the last module in our Getting Started Programming with Darts class. Basically as a programmer, especially working in a team, the majority of our time will be spent reading code rather than writing it. That's what the coding convention is for . Coding conventions are guides for specific programming languages ​​that recommend programming styles, practices, and methods for every aspect of programs written in that language. These conventions usually include indents, comments, declarations, naming, architecture, etc.

Code conventions are very important to programmers for the following reasons:

1. 40% - 80% of the cost of a software used for maintenance ( maintenance ).
2. It is very rare for a piece of software to be maintained on an ongoing basis by its original author.
3. Code conventions improve code readability, allowing programmers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.
4. Source code is more organized and clean as a product.

Dart has also developed coding conventions that aim to allow us to write consistent, robust, and fast code. This Convention Dart is known as the Effective Dart. In essence Effective Dart was created to achieve two things:

1. **Be consistent** (Consistent). When it comes to formatting there will be many subjective arguments about which one is better. But consistency will certainly be very helpful objectively.
2. **Be brief** . Dart is designed to be familiar with other programming languages ​​such as C, Java, JavaScript, etc. But Dart is coupled with other features that other languages ​​don't offer yet. If there are many ways to express something, of course you will use the most concise way, right?

## 02. Effective Dart Guide
The Guidelines from the Effective Dart are divided into four sections according to their function.

1. **Style guides** . Defines the rules for laying out and organizing code. This guide also specifies how to format an identifier, whether to use camelCase, _underscore, etc.
2. **Documentation guide** . This guide deals with what is and isn't in comments. Be it a documentation comment or a regular comment.
3. **Usage guides** . This guide teaches how to best utilize language features to implement behaviors. The use of statements or expressions will be discussed here.
4. **Design guides** . This is the broadest yet least binding guide. This guide covers how to design a consistent and usable API library.

Effective Dart has many rules . Each rule will be preceded by a keyword to determine how the nature of the rule. The five keywords include:

1. **DO** . When a rule begins with DO then the practice must always be followed.
2. **DON'T** . On the other hand, a rule starting with DON'T is not a good thing to implement.
3. **PREFERRED** . This is a practice to be followed. However, there may be circumstances where it makes more sense to do otherwise. Make sure you understand the consequences when you ignore this rule.
3. **AVOID** . This is the opposite of PREFER. This guide explains what not to do, but there may be good reasons to do so in some cases.
4. **CONSIDER** . These guidelines are practices you can follow or not follow, depending on your own circumstances and preferences.

While there are tons of rules and guidelines that need to be followed in Effective Dart, we don't have to worry about the rules being too strict. Because most of the existing guides can be said to be common sense in making programs, even if they are not written. In addition, conventions aim to make our code better, easier to read, and of course to maintain.
