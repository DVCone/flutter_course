# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Paradigm of OOP
In the first module we already know that Dart is a language that supports object-oriented programming. OOP is a programming paradigm that is widely used today for developing applications.

The OOP paradigm is based on the concept of objects that have attributes and can perform certain operations or procedures. With OOP, we can easily visualize objects that exist in the real world into computer programs. For example, imagine a cat as an object. This cat object has characteristics such as coat color, cat age, and weight. These characteristics are called *attributes* or *properties*. In addition, cats can also do several things such as eating, sleeping, and playing. The behavior of this cat object is a *method*.

There are 4 (four) pillars in object-oriented programming, including: *encapsulation*, *abstraction*, *inheritance*, and *polymorphism*.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a condition where the state or condition in the `class`, is wrapped and is private. This means that other objects cannot access or change the value of the `property` directly. In the example of the cat case, we cannot directly change the weight of the cat, but we can add it through the function or feeding `method`.

### Abstraction
Abstraction is arguably a natural application of encapsulation. Abstraction means that an object only performs its operations in a *high-level* manner. For example, we know enough about how a cat eats, but we don't need to know what the biological metabolism in a cat's body is that makes her gain weight.

### Inheritance
Some objects can have some characteristics or behavior in common, but they are not the same object. This is where inheritance or inheritance comes into play. Cats have traits and behaviors that are common with other animals, such as having a color, weight, etc. Therefore, the cat as a child object (*subclass*) inherits all the properties and behaviors of its parent object (*superclass*). Likewise, fish objects also inherit the same characteristics and behavior, but fish can swim while cats cannot.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism in Greek means "many forms." Simply put, objects can have different forms or implementations in the same method. All animals breathe, but of course cats and fish have a different way of breathing. The difference in shape or way of breathing is an example of polymorphism.

## 02. Class
One of the main features of OOP is features like **class**. *Class is a blueprint* for creating objects. In this class we define the properties (*attributes*) and *behavior* of the object to be created. For example, the Animal class has attributes such as name, weight, and age, etc. Then the behavior is eating, sleeping, etc.

Each class has *attributes* and *behavior*. In Dart we define *attributes* with variables, while *behavior* is often represented as a *function*.

|attribute        |behavior   |
|-----------------|-----------|
|String name      |eat()      |
|int age          |sleep()    |
|double weight    |poop()     |

To define a class in Dart, just use the keyword `class` followed by the name of the class to be created.

```dart
class Animal {
}
```

Then we can add variables and functions to the class.

```dart
//Animal Class
class Animal {
  //Attribute
  String name;
  int age;
  double weight;
  
  //Map
  Animal(this.name, this.age, this.weight);
  
  //Behavior Function
  void eat() {
    print('$name is eating.');
    weight = weight + 0.2;
  }
  
  void sleep() {
    print('$name is sleeping.');
  }

  void poop() {
    print('$name is pooping.');
    weight = weight - 0.1;
  }
}
```

Then to create an object of a class, use the following syntax: `var nameOfObject = NameOfClass(property1, property2);`

An object is like a variable, meaning we can use `var` to initialize an object. Objects stored in this variable are also known as *instances* or *instances of a class*. This *instance* stores the *reference* or memory address of the object. The process of creating an instance variable as above is called *instantiation*.

`var garfieldCat = Animal('Garfield', 2, 4.2);`

We use the class name followed by parentheses. Inside these brackets we can pass parameters to initialize the values ​​in the object. This parenthesis is a *constructor* that we will study in the next material. After the object is created we can run a function or display the value of the *property* in it.

```dart
void main() {
  var garfieldCat = Animal('Garfield', 2, 4.2);
  garfieldCat.eat();
  garfieldCat.poop();
  print(garfieldCat.weight);
}

/* Output :
> Gray is eating.
> Gray is pooping.
> 4.300000000000001
*/
```
